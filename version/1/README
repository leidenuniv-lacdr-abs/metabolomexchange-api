In 2014 a first version of the API was released as part of MetabolomeXchange.org. This API has now been extracted from the front-end logic and is now the core feature of MetabolomeXchange on which all services are built on top on. Biggest change compared to the old API is that it runs without a database. Before we used a MongoDB document store as a persistent layer, now all are simple (cached) text files.
